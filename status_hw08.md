Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Sanjana Dutt


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/sanjdutt/webdevhw07.git

Note: I just worked off my hw07 repo, so that is why it says webdevhw07. 

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

events.sanjanawebdev.xyz



4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

Yes, it is complete except adding the profile picture. 



5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?


Yes, it is deployed. There is something going on with my database password because every time I try to log in with my password it gives me an error even though I tried to reset it. All my code works perfectly fine in the localhost 4000, so I know that it is only an issue with the external data base files -- production release is not signing into the database correctly. That is why when you try to login with a username it gives an internal service error. I tried to reset my password a few times on Postgres, but it kept giving me an error that the password did not exist. 

Not sure if that made sense, but please let me know if you have any questions further about this and I would be happy to explain it! I went to office hours about this and the TA did not know what was going on either. If you look at all my files in my git repo you can see that everything is working correctly and all my functionalities are working perfectly fine in the local host. 


And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
