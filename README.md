# HW07: Event Manager (Part 1)

## Code Attribution

This homework includes code from and based on Prof Tuck's in-class PhotoBlog example.


## Design Decisions

- Anyone can create a new event, view an existing event, and edit an event, 
  but they must be registered and logged in to do so
- Similar to Photo Blog, all events are displayed on the home page
- Even if user is registered, they can never navigate to the listing users 
  view 
- Users can edit their information by clicking their name at the top
- Date picker must take time in 24-hour format
